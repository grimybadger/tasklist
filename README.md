# twitch
Task list application developed in Unity and controlled via Twitch Chat or through the app.
I created this task list as a way to help me keep track of my work.
The main idea is to allow only the broadcaster to keep track of their work but I may expand it to the viewers as well.

Displaying It:
  • Streamlabs captures the application and then I resize it in StreamLabs.
  • I also have StreamLabs manage the transparency.
  
Current Available Functionality:
  • You can add/remove/rename tasks, pause the timer, or choose not to display the timer.
  
Future Updates:
  • On application closing I want to automatically save all my task statistics.
  • Allow customization of background images and colors.
  • Have the images and text scale properly according to screen size.
