**TASKLIST**

Tasklist application built in Unity that allows you to keep track of your work.

I sometimes stream and I wanted to create a task list that only I could interact with via twitch chat.

In the future I may add the feature that allows viewers to interact with the tasklist. 

**Usage**

• Everything highlighted is interactable via left mouse click or right mouse click

• Should feel intuitive to use
  
**Current Features**

• Add/remove tasks

• Rename tasks

• Display/Hide timer

**Future Updates**

• Azure integration to keep track of task statistics 

• Allow list to be controlled via Twitch chat commands

• Allow for background image customization
